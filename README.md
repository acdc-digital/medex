**Initial Hypothesis:** 
I am going to combine the latest therapies and counselling strategies, with the latest (and one of the largest) medical language models. It will be called Med-Exec, your Medical Executive Assistant for medical relationships. The main feature is you can add all your personal medical information (supported in a variety of formats, which can be diagnostic), then ask the assistant questions about it. With reference to the internet’s vast information, it will chat in a responsive but informative way. Users can select information from that text which they may want to share for informational purposes with family or friends. That way, they can add peers individually like WhatsApp, then those people can talk to your assistant directly and only about the information you want them to know about. You can also add your doctors, which will allow them to review other Doctors’ notes. 

An important distinction is that the app is not designed for communicating. It’s designed so that your assistant can put together puzzle pieces that may be emotionally challenging, and/ or physically difficult to interpret and then relay in comprehensive way.

That way, everyone in your circle can learn in their own way, at their own level, and come together later to discuss outside of the app, and once your assistant has helped get everyone on the same page. If your circle feels they don’t know how to discuss your situation, the flip side is the application is also trained on the latest counselling and therapy techniques. So you can just ask it what to ask/ say/ talk about, etc. making it easier for everyone to communicate in a unified language while also having a safe place they can ask their questions to the assistant, rather than potentially mis-speaking in a potentially vulnerable situation. 

The goal of Med-Exec is to provide a safe place to hold your medical history, learn about it, and share it in ways that feel less vulnerable, and give others the opportunity to learn in their own way.
